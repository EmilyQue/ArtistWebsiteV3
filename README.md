# ArtistWebsiteV3
This is an artist website made for CST341. We are coding in Java and using the Spring Framework.

This website is created by Almicke "Mickey" Navarro and Emily Quevedo. We are both currently juniors at Grand Canyon University. We are also Computer Programming majors.

We are currently on Milestone 6. This Milestone requires us to demonstrate the use of jQuery.
