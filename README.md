# ArtistWebsiteV3
This is an artist website made for CST341. We are coding in Java and using the Spring Framework.

This website is created by Almicke "Mickey" Navarro and Emily Quevedo. We are both currently juniors at Grand Canyon University. We are also Computer Programming majors.

We are currently on Milestone 5. This Milestone requires us to demonstrate our knowledge of building a maven version of our project. We also must demonstrate the knowledge from past milestones by creating a product display, update, and delete. Through that, we have created...

  Model: User, Event
  
  View: homePage, loginPage, registrationPage, createEventPage, adminEventsPage, editEventPage
  
  Controller: UserController, EventController
  
With the use of these pages, we have created these login, registration, user CRUD and event CRUD modules.
